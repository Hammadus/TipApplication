# Pre-work - *TipCalc*

**TipCalc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: ** Hammad Saeed **

Time spent: ** 19 ** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. 
This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Making the app Color blind friendly would improve the functionality. The splash screens make the contrast lower between 
the numbers and the background.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I have relatively little experiance with programming so the syntax with swift was confuing at times. 
For user defaults I was unsure where exaclty to place the outlets and actions despite watching videos and 
searching on Stack Overflow. I spent more time reading and trying to find a solution than I spent wrinting
the code, the settings options is almost complete, just not sure where to place the commands.
